# While-For-Loops
Short programs demonstrating the capabilities of while and for loops in Python.

While loop-
Program continously asks a user for a number.
When the user enteres "-1" the program will end.
It will then calculate the average of numbers entered excluding -1

For loop-
The objective was to create a star pattern.
This needed to be done using just one for loop.
The program utilises counters and the length function to achieve this.
